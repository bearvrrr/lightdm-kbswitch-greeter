# LightDM Kbswitch Greeter Configuration
# This is a GTK based greeter that allows changing the keyboard layout before
# starting a session. Available configuration options are listed below
#
# Appearance:
#  background = Background to use. Either:
#    1. a path to an image file. The way the image is scaled to fit the monitor
#       may be specified by prefixing the path with either '#zoomed:',
#       '#stretched:' or '#source:'. #zoomed fits the image to the monitor and
#       preserves the aspect ratio within the image such that once it is
#       zoomed it is cropped to fit the monitor. #stretched stretches the image
#       to the monitor, #source uses the image at its original size so that if
#       the image is larger than the monitor, any excess is cropped
#    2. a colour in hexedecimal notation (e.g. #1793d1)
#    3. or the value '#skip' if monitor is not to be used for the greeter. In
#       this case the login interface will not be rendered on that monitor. If
#       all monitors have the background value #skip then one will be selected
#       to draw the interface on with the default background.
#    The default background is black (#000000)
#  theme-name = a GTK3 theme to use
#  icon-theme-name = Icon theme to use
#  cursor-theme-name = cursor theme to use
#  clock-format = strftime-format string, e.g. %H:%M
#  date-format = strftime-format string, e.g. %A %d %B
#
# Fonts:
#  font-name = Font to use
#  xft-antialias = false|true  Whether to antialias Xft fonts
#  xft-dpi = Resolution for Xft in dots per inch (e.g. 96)
#  xft-hintstyle = none|slight|medium|hintfull  What degree of hinting to use
#  xft-rgba = none|rgb|bgr|vrgb|vbgr  Type of subpixel antialiasing
#
# Keyboard layout:
#  default-keyboard-layout = keyboard layout in the form of the country and
#    optionally variant separated by whitespace (e.g. 'gb' for United Kingdom
#    Qwerty layout or 'gb dvorak' for United Kingdom Dvorak layout). This
#    layout will always appear in the layout selection menu
#  keyboard-layout-regions = a semi-colon seperated list of regions to appear
#    in the keyboard layout selection menu (e.g. gb;fr will produce a menu with
#    all the available United Kingdom and French layouts)
#  keyboard-layouts = a semi-colon separated list of keyboard layouts (as
#    specified for default-keyboard-layout) to be included in the keyboard
#    layout selection menu. This option can be used in addition to the
#    keyboard-layout-regions option.
#
# Desktop session selection
#  default-session = Default session to use. Either a session name or '#last'
#    to use the last session for that user
#
# Per monitor configuration
# The background can be set on a per monitor basis as per the following
# template
#   [monitor: name]
#   background = overrides the default
